Highlights of Cart.php and mystore.php 

- Use of Encapsulation; see the method checkSubtotal().  Chose to keep checkSubtotal() private so that it would only be visible to the Cart object.
- Initially thought overload the method additem() but instead decided to use the "products" array to hold all the products with their associated attributes; price and weight.
- To see the scenarios in action, created the application mystore.php
- This application is a good candidate for Design Patterns like MVC and Factory
